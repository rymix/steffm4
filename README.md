Stef.fm is an online music streaming platform which I am using as a permanent home for my late friend's amazing house music mix collection. I explain more in my [LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/passion-project-digital-preservation-archaeology-steve-arnott/).

The UI is based on the Roland Jupiter-8 keyboard from the 1980s. It's a classic design that I've always loved.
